Project name: Waterworld

Waterworld is a crowdfunding facilitator program that enables a user, the prospective donor, to inspect worldwide water needs and donate money intended for a specific location selected by the donor. When enough money for a location has accrued, an order for water is dispatched meant to have water delivered to that area.


Long description:
Capstone Project

   Waterworld is a crowdfunding facilitator program that enables a user, the prospective donor, to inspect worldwide water needs and donate money intended for a specific location selected by the donor. The user can see a map overlaid with a heat map of calculated need for water. The user can select any area and see details of that area, including current news stories that address and expose the lack of access to water for the people in that area. The donor will have full access to the fate of the donation, including where the money has gone, what was purchased with it, and the destination of that which was purchased.

   Money donated on behalf of a location goes into the Waterworld account and, when the money donated on behalf of an area reaches a particular threshold, an administrator will dispatch an order for water to that region using the donated funds. Earlier versions of the project will dispatch this order to a particular (potentially simulated) distributor of water. Later iterations can allow potential water distributors, the vendors, to bid on the contract for that order using the applicationâ€™s auction functionality.

   The intended functionality of the prototype product is that a user can access the application, optionally log in, donate money for a particular region, and see an order eventually dispatched to a dummy distributor when enough money has been accrued.

Upon adding the following, the prototype product will be considered minimally viable:

1. Heat map
2. Vendor auction system


The following enumerate the stretch goals:

1. List view of pools
2. Information popups, including relevant articles
3. React native app
4. Vendor history and evaluation
5. User reporting of need via app
6. User reporting of need via SMS
7. Algorithm to calculate need based on whatever data may be available taking into account the user reports
8. Additional dispatch type options (e.g., bore to make a well as a permanent solution instead of water)
